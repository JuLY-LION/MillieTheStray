			If you have some time, I have a story I'd like to tell you.<br>
			<br>
			It's Augest 16th, 2016. A typical bright and summer day at home. It was so great that the whole family was outside. Well, everyone except me anyways. I was stuck indoors doing math homework. It's then that my sister comes in my room excited.
			<blockquote>"There's a stray dog in our yard, come see!"</blockquote>
			Sure enough, there was a fairly large dog in our front yard, and without a collar or harness. But she was surpringly friendly if she indeed a stray, as they usually have a waryness around humans. Afterall, mistreatment is usually the cause of their homelessness.<br>
			With that said, she was starving. We all could see the outline of her ribs. But we had extra dog food on hand as our neighbor's dog had passed away recently from old age, and they donated the wet dog food they still had left. We opened the can and this poor stray basically inhaled the entire thing. She was very grateful.<br>
			So we played fetch with her in the yard. Why not? It's not like we had somewhere to be. And she absolutely adored the exercise and attention. Eventually I got curious what her breed was. She looked kinda like a german shepard but not quite. But I knew how to find out quickly.
			
			My older brother - let's call him Rhett - decided she could use a bath, so he filled up the plastic kiddle pool with the hose. The dog didn't seem to mind, and mostly cooperated through her bath.
